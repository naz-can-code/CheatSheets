# 📚 Cheat Sheets & Resources by Nazish Khalid

## Welcome to my personal collection of cheat sheets, data notes, and useful resources! 👩‍💻✨
I’m learning new things every day – especially around Data, SQL, Power BI, and other tech tools – and I love creating simple, easy-to-read guides that help me (and hopefully others!) learn faster.

Whether you're just starting out or need a quick refresher, feel free to explore and use anything here!

##  Why I'm Doing This
Learning tech can feel overwhelming – too many tabs, too much jargon, and not enough simple steps.
This repo is my way of breaking things down into small, visual, and practical notes.

✅ For beginners
✅ For non-tech friends
✅ For anyone who wants to learn, one step at a time

## Got Questions or Suggestions?
